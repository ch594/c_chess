This is a console based chess application. Currently I have implemented all the rules for chess and I'm working on move generation.

I am starting to add support for playing over a network. I'm using SFML for the networking section and also using this as an opportunity to learn SFML.

To compile just run make. It has a dependecy on SFML 2.1. I've also used GCC 4.8.4 to compile.
